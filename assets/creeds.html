<h2>Nicene Creed</h2>
<p>
I believe in one God, the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth, and of all things visible and invisible.
</p><p>
And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only-begotten Son of God, begotten of the Father before all worlds; God of God, Light of Light, very God of very God; begotten, not made, being of one substance with the Father, by whom all things were made.
</p><p>
Who, for us men and for our salvation, came down from heaven, and was incarnate by the Holy Spirit of the virgin Mary, and was made man; and was crucified also for us under Pontius Pilate; He suffered and was buried; and the third day He rose again, according to the Scriptures; and ascended into heaven, and sits on the right hand of the Father; and He shall come again, with glory, to judge the quick and the dead; whose kingdom shall have no end.
</p><p>
And I believe in the Holy Ghost, the Lord and Giver of Life; who proceeds from the Father and the Son; who with the Father and the Son together is worshipped and glorified; who spoke by the prophets.
</p><p>
And I believe in one holy catholic<sup>1</sup> and apostolic Church. I acknowledge one baptism for the remission of sins; and I look for the resurrection of the dead, and the life of the world to come.
<br />Amen.

<h2>Athanasian Creed</h2>
<p>
Whosoever will be saved, before all things it is necessary that he hold the catholic<sup>1</sup> faith;
</p><p>
Which faith except every one do keep whole and undefiled, without doubt he shall perish everlastingly.
</p><p>
And the catholic faith is this: That we worship one God in Trinity, and Trinity in Unity;
</p><p>
Neither confounding the persons, nor dividing the substance
</p><p>
For there is one Person of the Father, another of the Son and another of the Holy Spirit.
</p><p>
But the Godhead of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit is all one, the glory equal, the majesty co-eternal.
</p><p>
Such as the Father is, such is the Son and such is the Holy Spirit.
</p><p>
The Father uncreated, the Son uncreated, and the Holy Spirit uncreated.
</p><p>
The Father incomprehensible, the Son incomprehensible, and the Holy Spirit incomprehensible.
</p><p>
The Father eternal, the Son eternal, and the Holy Spirit eternal.
</p><p>
And yet they are not three eternals, but one eternal.
</p><p>
As also there are not three uncreated nor three incomprehensibles, but one uncreated and one incomprehensible.
</p><p>
So likewise the Father is almighty, the Son almighty, and the Holy Spirit almighty;
</p><p>
And yet they are not three almighties, but one almighty.
</p><p>
So the Father is God, the Son is God, and the Holy Spirit is God;
</p><p>
And yet they are not three Gods, but one God.
</p><p>
So likewise the Father is Lord, the Son Lord, and the Holy Spirit Lord;
</p><p>
And yet they are not three Lords, but one Lord.
</p><p>
For like as we are compelled by the Christian verity to acknowledge every person by himself to be God and Lord;
</p><p>
so are we forbidden by the catholic religion to say: There are three Gods or three Lords.
</p><p>
The Father is made of none, neither created nor begotten.
</p><p>
The Son is of the Father alone; not made nor created, but begotten.
</p><p>
The Holy Spirit is of the Father and of the Son; neither made, nor created, nor begotten, but proceeding.
</p><p>
So there is one Father, not three Fathers; one Son, not three Sons; one Holy Spirit, not three Holy Spirits.
</p><p>
And in this Trinity none is afore, nor after another; none is greater, or less than another.
</p><p>
But the whole three persons are co-eternal, and co-equal.
</p><p>
So that in all things, as aforesaid, the Unity in Trinity and the Trinity in Unity is to be worshipped.
</p><p>
He therefore that will be saved must thus think of the Trinity.
</p><p>
Furthermore it is necessary to everlasting salvation that he also believe rightly the incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ.
</p><p>
For the right faith is that we believe and confess that our Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is God and man.
</p><p>
God of the substance of the Father, begotten before the worlds; and made of the substance of His mother, born in the world.
</p><p>
Perfect God and perfect man, of a reasonable soul and human flesh subsisting.
</p><p>
Equal to the Father as touching His Godhead, and inferior to the Father as touching His manhood.
</p><p>
Who, although He is God and man, yet He is not two, but one Christ.
</p><p>
One, not by conversion of the Godhead into flesh, but by taking of the manhood into God.
</p><p>
One altogether, not by the confusion of substance, but by unity of person.
</p><p>
For as the reasonable soul and flesh is one man, so God and man is one Christ;
</p><p>
Who suffered for our salvation, descended into hell, rose again the third day from the dead;
</p><p>
He ascended into heaven, He sitteth on the right hand of the Father, God Almighty;
</p><p>
From thence He shall come to judge the living and the dead.
</p><p>
At whose coming all men shall rise again with their bodies;
</p><p>
And shall give account of their own works.
</p><p>
And they that have done good shall go into life everlasting, and they that have done evil into everlasting fire.
</p><p>
This is the catholic faith, which except a man believe faithfully, he cannot be saved.
